## Exchange Support

### Current Exchanges

#### Binance (CEX)
```python
# Enhanced from EventScanner with:
- 720-point historical data limit compliance
- Improved symbol mapping and validation
- Better error handling for 400 responses
- Async klines data processing
```

#### Coinbase Pro (CEX)
```python
# Fixed from EventScanner issues:
- 300-point limit handling with time range adjustment
- Improved granularity selection for historical data
- Better product ID mapping and validation
- Enhanced error recovery for API failures
```

### Adding New Exchanges

1. **Implement BaseExchange interface**:
```python
class NewExchange(BaseExchange):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("new_exchange", ExchangeType.CEX)
    
    async def get_current_price(self, token: Token) -> Optional[Price]:
        # Implementation
    
    async def get_historical_prices(self, token: Token, days: int, interval: str):
        # Implementation
```

2. **Register in ExchangeFactory**:
```python
self._exchange_classes["new_exchange"] = NewExchange
```

## Analysis Process

### Multi-Exchange Analysis Flow

1. **Token Selection**
   - Fetch prioritized tokens from wiggle-service
   - Filter by exchange support (minimum 2 exchanges required)
   - Apply volume and liquidity filters

2. **Price Data Collection**
   - Concurrent price fetching from all supported exchanges
   - Health checks and error handling
   - Price validation and sanity checks

3. **Opportunity Detection**
   - Analyze all exchange pair combinations (N√óN matrix)
   - Calculate gross returns and apply cost models
   - Filter by minimum profitability thresholds

4. **Historical Analysis**
   - Fetch historical price data (default 30 days)
   - Find historical arbitrage opportunities
   - Combine with current analysis for comprehensive view

5. **Results Processing**
   - Create MultiExchangeOpportunity objects
   - Submit to wiggle-service API
   - Track performance metrics and analytics

### Cost-Aware Evaluation

```python
# From EventScanner learnings:
net_return = gross_return - gas_impact - trading_fees

# Where:
gas_impact = (35.0 / capital_usd) * 100  # $35 gas cost
trading_fees = 0.6  # 0.6% combined exchange fees
minimum_net_return = 6.0  # 6% threshold for profitability
```

## Performance & Monitoring

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check overall system health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # If metrics endpoint enabled
